#equivalent appart from init chat with other agent instead of generate reply
use autogen chat massage format
handle final answer
fix init chat

The Orchestrator operates in two main loops:

Outer Loop (Task Ledger):
Receives the initial task
Creates/updates a Task Ledger containing:
Given or verified facts
Facts that need to be looked up
Facts that need to be derived through computation/logic
Educated guesses
A task plan
Inner Loop (Progress Ledger):
Maintains a Progress Ledger to track:
Whether the task is complete
If there are unproductive loops
If progress is being made
Which agent should act next
Instructions for the next agent
The Orchestrator's decision flow:

Checks if task is complete - if yes, reports final answer
If not complete, checks if progress is being made
If progress is being made, continues with the current plan
If no progress is made, checks a "stall count"
If stall count exceeds 2, returns to update the Task Ledger
Otherwise, continues directing other agents (Coder, ComputerTerminal, WebSurfer, FileSurfer) to execute subtasks
