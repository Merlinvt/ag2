The main part of the code then iterates through numbers 2 to 1000, calling `is_prime` for each and printing those that are prime.\\n\\n\\n**Key Findings/Outcomes:**\\n\\n* The program successfully identifies and prints all prime numbers between 1 and 1000.\\n* The `is_prime` function utilizes an optimized algorithm to improve efficiency, particularly for larger numbers.  A naive approach would be significantly slower.\\n\\n\\n**Caveats/Limitations:**\\n\\n* While this algorithm is efficient for numbers up to 1000,  for significantly larger ranges (e.g., millions or billions),  consider using more advanced prime-finding algorithms or libraries for better performance.  The current approach\\'s runtime increases with the square root of the input range.\\n* The output is printed to the console. For very large ranges, this might become unwieldy.  Consider writing the output to a file for better management.\\n\\n\\nLet me know if you have any further requests or need modifications to this code!\\n'"
