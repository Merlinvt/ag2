Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\\\\n\\\\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\\\\n   - The request is about \\\\\\\"the magnetic one agent from Microsoft.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\\\\n   - Detailed information about \\\\\\\"the magnetic one agent from Microsoft.\\\\\\\" This might involve searching Microsoft's official website, technology news sites, or databases that cover software and technology products.\\\\n\\\\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\\\\n   - Determine if \\\\\\\"magnetic one agent\\\\\\\" is a specific product, feature, or project by Microsoft, or if there might be a misunderstanding or typo in the request.\\\\n\\\\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\\\\n   - \\\\\\\"Magnetic one agent\\\\\\\" might be a misinterpretation or typo for a Microsoft product or service. It could potentially refer to a software agent or tool related to Microsoft's AI, machine learning, or cloud services.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\\\\n\\\\n- **Clarify the Request**: Double-check if \\\\\\\"magnetic one agent\\\\\\\" is the correct term or if there might be a typo or misunderstanding. This can be done by considering similar-sounding Microsoft products or services.\\\\n\\\\n- **Initial Web Search**: Instruct WebSurfer to perform a web search for \\\\\\\"magnetic one agent Microsoft\\\\\\\" to see if there are any direct results or related topics.\\\\n\\\\n- **Explore Microsoft Resources**: If the initial search does not yield results, direct WebSurfer to explore Microsoft's official website, particularly sections related to software, AI, or cloud services, to find any relevant information.\\\\n\\\\n- **Check Technology News Sites**: Have WebSurfer search technology news sites or databases for any mentions of \\\\\\\"magnetic one agent\\\\\\\" or similar terms in the context of Microsoft.\\\\n\\\\n- **Summarize Findings**: Once relevant information is found, summarize the details to address the original request comprehensively.\\\\n\\\"}}\", \"timestamp\": \"2024-12-17 17:40:56.885244\", \"thread_id\": 140704434826688}\n",
